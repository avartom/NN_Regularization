# Neural Network Regularization

Continue to use TensorFlow Keras & a sample of the Quickdraw dataset to build a sketch classification model. The dataset has been sampled to only 10 classes and 10000 observations per class. Apply regularization techniques to your model.

Objectives: 

In lecture, we were exposed to several regularization techniques: Lp space regularization, Max Norm weight constraints, and dropout regularization.

1: We explore the effects of these regularization techniques on model performance and on the learned model weights.

2: We review how to save a model and how to retrieve the saved model from a file.
